# Distributed File System - Development Roadmap

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Implemented Features

**Core Architecture**
- **Coordinator Service**: Manages metadata (file → chunk mapping) and cluster state (node membership)
- **DataNode Service**: Stores chunk data on disk with replication to peers
- **Client SDK**: Handles file chunking, parallel uploads/downloads, and metadata confirmation
- **gRPC Streaming**: Bidirectional streaming with back-pressure control and checksums

**File Operations**
- **Upload**: Complete implementation with chunking, replication (factor 3), and metadata commit
- **Download**: Complete implementation with chunk retrieval from multiple replica nodes
- **Node Management**: Registration, heartbeat, and incremental cluster state updates

**Storage Layer**
- **Chunk Storage**: Disk-based storage with nested directory structure (avoids filesystem limitations)
- **Serialization**: Protobuf-based chunk header serialization with data integrity checks
- **Replication**: Parallel replication to multiple nodes with configurable timeout

**Testing & Infrastructure**
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive coverage for core components (coordinator, datanode, client)
- **E2E Tests**: Upload functionality with varying file sizes and chunk sizes
- **Docker Compose**: Local development environment with 1 coordinator + 6 datanodes

### ❌ Missing/Incomplete Features

**Critical Gaps**
1. **File Operations**: DeleteFile and ListFiles gRPC methods defined but not implemented
2. **Metadata Persistence**: Currently in-memory only (lost on coordinator restart)
3. **Garbage Collection**: No cleanup mechanism for orphaned chunks
4. **CLI Interface**: Basic client exists but lacks user-friendly commands

**Security & Reliability**
5. **Authentication**: No TLS, JWT, or mTLS implementation
6. **Authorization**: No access control or user management
7. **Data Integrity**: No at-rest encryption or erasure coding
8. **Failure Recovery**: Limited fault tolerance mechanisms

**Operational Features**
9. **HTTP Gateway**: Stubbed but no REST API implementation
10. **Observability**: No metrics, tracing, or structured monitoring
11. **Configuration**: Runtime configuration needs improvement (currently compile-time constants)
12. **Capacity Management**: No load balancing or storage rebalancing

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Completion

**Priority 1: Essential File Operations**
- [ ] **Implement DeleteFile operation**
  - Add coordinator logic for file deletion
  - Implement chunk cleanup on datanodes
  - Add client SDK support
  - Write comprehensive tests

- [ ] **Implement ListFiles operation**

**Priority 2: Garbage Collection**
- [ ] **Orphaned Chunk Detection**
  - Implement chunk reference counting
  - Add periodic cleanup jobs -> if some chunk is not referenced in the metadata, it is marked for deletion, actually deleted after a certain timeout.
